This folder contains some sample unit tests for the project

We're using the basic mocha framework so that we don't have to include Node and yet another dependency into the project, even though other frameworks are easier or more powerful.

To run all the unit tests, server run-all-tests.html from a server and run it from a browser. If in Visual Studio Code, right click on run-all-tests.html and select Open with Live Server.

Each javascript file in the main project has (or can have) it's own test file in this folder, which can be included in run-all-tests.html
